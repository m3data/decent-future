# Principles and Values
Why does this matter? We all have and hold these individually. Some reading this may not often reflect upon them or question them to much depth. We learn them via osmosis, from our families, friends, teachers colleagues, peers and culture. What makes us powerful as a force for change is the collectively held narratives we believe. For communities or systems to function, underlying rules or principles are explicitly or implicitly present. So here we are at some early juncture espousing what will lead to emergent behaviour and properties as we move onward.

### Principles
These principles are here to guide the work we do individually and collectively. To recognise why we do it and how we do our great work.

#### Imagination
Imagination is one of our greatest gifts. We will harness the individual and collective imagination to create a better world for all living beings.

#### Practical outcomes
Create the vision for what we want to bring about and take the practical steps needed to turn it into a reality. One step and task at a time.

#### Support and commitment
By supporting each other and committing to what we agree upon, what to stand for, how to continually learn, what to actively and collectively create, we progress.

## Values
These are some of the values that serve as a reference point for further expansion and refinement. Dogmatism is not the purpose, we are fallible and so to the values we have and hold. These are not laid down in order of importance and some may be preconditions for others so some hierarchy may emerge through collaborative efforts and contributions.

#### Integrity
Community members have integrity. We hold ourselves and each other to account, helping each other learn and grow.

#### Authenticity
We support and accept each other as we are, encouraging each other to be genuine and not hold back while respecting. 

#### Diversity
We support and pursue diversity, understanding the crucial role it plays in our community, markets and broader ecosystems.

#### Inclusion
We aim for maximising the inclusion of all people, voices and perspectives, whenever practical. 

#### Human wellbeing
The aim of any systems we create is to enhance human wellbeing. Pursuing this in as many facets of work as is practically possible.

#### Education
Supporting the learning and education of ourselves and each other, the community and whoever is willing is an everyday pursuit.

#### Creativity
We pursue creative ways of solving problems and encourage divergent thinking in our methods and strategies for social change.

#### Collaboration
We aim to enhance the efforts and outcomes of our work by harnessing the skills and knowledge of the community members and people in our networks.

#### Self sovereignty
As individuals we are sovereign. We own and control our own bodies, in the Analogue and Digital realms and pursue this ends as a critical foundation of social change. 

#### Empathy
We connect with people emotionally and intellectually. Aiming to be mindful of each others uniqueness while recognising our fundamental collective similarities.

#### Patience
We respect and nurture patience in ourselves, in our interactions with others and in our community efforts and initiatives.

#### Persistence
Our aims are long term and many failures and complex problems will be encountered. Despite this we persist and support each other in these challenges.

#### Adaptability
When the facts and our individual and collective wisdom indicates change is needed, we pursue it. When situations demand fast adaption, we pursue it.

### Adapting these principles and values
These principles and values are not etched in stone as some set of commandments. They will change as we evolve. They will be edited and refined until the meaning they convey reflects the diverse contributors in the community.
